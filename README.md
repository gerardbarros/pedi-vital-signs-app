# Kid Vitals
This web application is used as a reference for pediatric vital signs based on age group.

**Link to project:** https://pediatricvitals.netlify.app/
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
HTML, CSS, Heroku, and Javascript were used to create this web application. I created my own API which takes the vital signs parameters in order to return it as data when the application is used.

## Lessons Learned:
I was able to apply lessons I learned by building my own API, hosting it via heroku, and turning it into a web applicaiton.
